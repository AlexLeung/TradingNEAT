  <Description>
    Single Pole Balancing in 2D, with physics simulation in Box2D. This domain is also known as the inverted pendulum.

    The problem consists of a cart on a rail with fixed length. The cart moves along the x-axis (x=0 represents the center of the rail).
    A single pole is attached to the cart with a hinge that allows the pole to move left and right.

    An external agent can push the cart with a fixed force of 100 Newtons either left or right.

    The task is for the controller to balance the pole for as long as possible by applying force to the cart.
    * Timesteps are in increments of 1/60th of a second.
    * Maximum timesteps for a trial is 21,600 (6 minutes clock time).

    The controller is considered to have failed if the cart runs off the ends of the track and/or abs(pole angle) is >= 12 degrees within the trial time.

    The model state variables are:
    * Cart position on rail (x-axis).
    * Cart velocity.
    * Pole angle.
    * Pole angular velocity.

    All four variables are provided to the controller; the velocity inputs in particular make the task an easy one to solve with no hidden nodes required.
